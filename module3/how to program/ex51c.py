# THIS IS THE FOURTH THING THAT YOU DO: DO A PSEUDO CODE FOR THE COMMENTS YOU MADE

# import the modules I need
import pdftotext
import sys for argv

# open the pdf
infile = open sys argv[1]

# convert it to text
pdf = pdftotext infile

linex = split pdf


# find Reporting Period
for line in lines
    if line starts with "Reporting Period"
        # print it
        print line

# print it
