# üß† How to Make a Game Program Using OOP (Inspired by Learn Python the Hard Way)

If you learn from how I made this game, you'll gain a clear understanding of how to build any kind of program using Object-Oriented Programming (OOP), not just games.

---

## üó∫Ô∏è Step-by-Step Roadmap to Build a Program

### 1. Start with Task Listing

List all the key tasks needed for your program.

**Example from the game:**
- Build the game logic  
- Add player interaction (UX)  
- Handle victory/defeat logic  

---

### 2. Break One Task Down

Take one task and break it down into manageable components.

**Example:**

**Task**: Making the Game  
**Breakdown:**
- A `Map` class to guide the player between rooms.  
- An `Engine` class to run the game flow.  
- A parent `Scene` class for inheritance.  
- Child scenes like `CentralCorridor`, `LaserWeaponArmory`, etc.  
- Events like `Death`, and `Finished`.  

---

### 3. Sketch Class Blueprints First

Write empty classes with `pass` and meaningful names.

```python
class Map:
    pass

class Engine:
    pass

class Scene:
    pass

class CentralCorridor(Scene):
    pass
```

This helps you structure before implementing.

---

### 4. Use Comments to Imagine Flow

Before writing any logic, imagine how your program will behave and write it as comments.

**Example from the `Map` class:**

```python
# Get the starting scene from __init__ and return it
# In next_scene, take a scene name and return the corresponding scene object
# Store all scene instances in a dictionary
```

By doing this, you mentally walk through your program before coding.

---

### 5. Design the Core Components First

Pick the core logic that powers your program and make sure it works first.

**For a game:**
- `Map` connects scenes.
- `Engine` controls game flow.

```python
class Map:
    scenes = {
        'central_corridor': CentralCorridor(),
        'death': Death(),
        'finished': Finished()
        # Add other scenes...
    }

    def __init__(self, start_scene):
        self.start_scene = start_scene

    def next_scene(self, scene_name):
        return self.scenes.get(scene_name, self.scenes['death'])

    def opening_scene(self):
        return self.scenes[self.start_scene]
```

```python
class Engine:
    def __init__(self, scene_map):
        self.map = scene_map

    def play(self):
        current_scene = self.map.opening_scene()
        last_scene = self.map.next_scene('finished')

        while current_scene != last_scene:
            next_scene_name = current_scene.enter()
            current_scene = self.map.next_scene(next_scene_name)

        current_scene.enter()
```

Test it with scenes that just print messages:

```python
class CentralCorridor(Scene):
    def enter(self):
        print("This is the Central Corridor.")
        return 'death'
```

---

### 6. Implement Real Scene Logic

Once the core loop works, go back and implement the actual scene logic using `input()` and your planned dialogue.

**Example:**

```python
class CentralCorridor(Scene):
    def enter(self):
        print("A Gothon blocks your way.")
        action = input("Choose 'shoot', 'dodge' or 'joke': ")

        if action == 'shoot':
            print("You die.")
            return 'death'
        elif action == 'joke':
            print("You pass!")
            return 'laser_weapon_armory'
        else:
            print("Try again.")
            return 'central_corridor'
```

---

### 7. Iterate and Improve

Now you can:
- Add new features  
- Improve UX  
- Add randomness (like guessing codes)  
- Handle invalid inputs safely  

---

### 8. Final Thoughts & Tips

‚úÖ Always test core logic first before filling in the fluff  
‚úÖ Use comments to design how data flows  
‚úÖ Make each class do one job  
‚úÖ Structure your project with reusable objects  
‚úÖ Think like an engineer and like a player at the same time

## ‚ú® Credits

This project was built by applying OOP lessons from *Learn Python the Hard Way*. It taught me how to structure programs, not just games ‚Äî and how to **think in terms of classes, flow, and responsibility**.
